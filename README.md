# Game-of-Life

This is a small model of John Connway's Game of Life simulation. This simulation is a supposed imitation of a bacterial model with certain boundaries and restrictions,
which determine the whether the bacteria will survive or not in the next day.

With such in mind, this program is a customizable simulation with the ability to save presets, load up previously saved or default (mathematical model) presets, as well
as automatically progress the day count.
